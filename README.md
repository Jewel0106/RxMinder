# RxMinder

## A React-based web application that keeps track of a person's medication through texting alerts.

##### Do you have an older family member who is sometimes forgetfull of their medication? Do they get defensive everytime you have to remind them to take their medication? Do they still hold on to their independence?

##### Then RxMinder is just what you need. It allows you to keep track of if and when your family member has taken their medication each day while they maintain their independence.

##### Upon signing up, the user is asked to input their patient's or family member's information.

##### The caretaker is then brought to the patient profile page where they can begin inputting information for each medication reminder. After a medication is submitted you can see a list of current reminders for the week.

##### After inputing all information needed for each medication reminder your home page will show a list of upcoming reminders for that day.

##### A text is sent to the patient at the time each medication should be taken. The patient must then respond to the text alert to confirm the medication was taken

#### After the patient confirms the medication was taken that reminder will turn blue.

##### When the patient has not responded to the text alert the reminder turns red to show this medication has been missed. The caretaker can then check in on the patient.
